#summary Where our design documents for Assignment 2 go.
= Introduction =
In this lab, we implemented many different things. The bulk of the lab was spent implementing various system calls related to file I/O and processes. The remainder of the lab was designing and implementing a scheduler.

= System Calls =
== File I/O ==
For this part, we needed to implement a few things before we could implement the actual system calls - namely, file descriptors and a file descriptor table for each thread.

File Descriptors -
Our file descriptor design includes a few integral elements. Most importantly, it includes a pointer to a vnode struct, which represents the interface to a single file in the filesystem. It also includes integers which represent whether the file is readable or writable. Lastly, it includes a uio struct which represents the location in the file, and has a pointer to any data that is read from a file.
